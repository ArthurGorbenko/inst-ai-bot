# Project Implementation Plan

## Goal
Transform the existing video processing pipeline into a modular HTTP server that can receive videos over HTTP, process them through configurable analysis pipelines, and return JSON results.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Server Foundation  COMPLETED
- [x] **Analyze current pipeline architecture and dependencies**
- [x] **Design API contract and request/response structure**  
- [x] **Create FastAPI server foundation with file upload**

**What we built:**
- FastAPI server (`server.py`) with REST endpoints
- File upload handling with temporary storage
- Job tracking system with unique IDs
- Async processing foundation
- Basic test infrastructure (`test_server.py`)

**Key endpoints:**
- `POST /analyze` - Upload video and request analysis
- `GET /analyze/{job_id}` - Check status and get results
- `DELETE /analyze/{job_id}` - Cancel job and cleanup
- `GET /health` - Health check

### Phase 2: Pipeline Modularization âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Extract pipeline steps into modular functions**
- [x] **Create analysis type configuration system**
- [x] **Integrate modular pipeline with HTTP server**

**What we built:**
- Two independent analysis types: `multimodal` and `structured`
- `video_processor/analysis.py` - Modular analysis functions
- `video_processor/pipeline.py` - Simple router between analysis types
- Updated `server.py` with async processing using thread pools
- Non-blocking job processing - server returns immediately with job ID

**Analysis Types Implemented:**
- `multimodal` - Uses TwelveLabs API for comprehensive video analysis
- `structured` - Runs complete internal pipeline (scene detection â†’ OCR â†’ transcription â†’ matching â†’ summary)

**Technical Improvements:**
- Async background processing prevents server blocking
- Proper file type validation (MIME type + file extension)
- Thread pool execution for CPU-intensive analysis tasks

### Phase 3: MongoDB Integration & Persistence ðŸ”„ NEXT
- [ ] **Create MongoDB collections for job tracking**
- [ ] **Persist job status and metadata to database**
- [ ] **Store analysis results in separate collection**
- [ ] **Add job recovery mechanism for server restarts**

**Goals:**
- Replace in-memory job storage with MongoDB persistence
- Separate collections: `jobs` (status, metadata) and `results` (analysis outputs)
- Enable job recovery after server restarts
- Maintain job history and analytics

**Collections Design:**
- `jobs` collection: job_id, status, video_metadata, created_at, updated_at
- `results` collection: job_id, analysis_type, results, processing_time

### Phase 4: Production Optimization ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling and logging**
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting and request validation**
- [ ] **Add monitoring and health checks**
- [ ] **Performance optimization for concurrent requests**

**Goals:**
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Request rate limiting and resource management
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Load testing and performance optimization

## Analysis Types Implemented

### Currently Available in Pipeline:
- `multimodal` - TwelveLabs comprehensive analysis ï¿½ (needs video upload integration)
- `scene_detection` - Extract key frames and timestamps
- `transcription` - Audio-to-text using Whisper  
- `ocr` - Text extraction from scene images
- `captioning` - AI scene descriptions using BLIP
- `matching` - Align transcriptions with visual scenes
- `structured_summary` - Generate searchable summaries via OpenAI
- `full_pipeline` - Complete end-to-end processing

### Dependencies Between Analysis Types:
- `matching` requires both `transcription` and `scene_detection`
- `structured_summary` requires scene data (from `ocr`, `captioning`, etc.)
- `full_pipeline` requires all components

## Technical Architecture

### Current State:
```
HTTP Request ï¿½ FastAPI ï¿½ Temp File Storage ï¿½ [Placeholder Processing] ï¿½ JSON Response
```

### Target State:
```
HTTP Request ï¿½ FastAPI ï¿½ Temp File Storage ï¿½ Modular Pipeline ï¿½ MongoDB (optional) ï¿½ JSON Response
                                        ï¿½
                              Route to requested analysis types
                              (scene_detection, transcription, etc.)
```

## Files Status

###  Completed Files:
- `server.py` - FastAPI server with endpoints
- `test_server.py` - Integration tests
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

### =' Files to Modify:
- Individual `video_processor/*.py` files - Extract into modular functions
- `server.py` - Integrate actual analysis functions (currently using placeholders)

### =ï¿½ Files to Create:
- `video_processor/pipeline.py` - Modular pipeline orchestrator
- `video_processor/analysis_router.py` - Route requests to appropriate modules

## Environment Setup

### Required:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m fastapi dev server.py  # Development
python -m fastapi run server.py  # Production
```

### Testing:
```bash
python test_server.py  # Automated tests
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" -F "video=@video.mp4" -F "analyses=multimodal"
```

### API Documentation:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Success Criteria

 **Phase 1 Complete:** Server accepts video uploads and returns job IDs
<ï¿½ **Phase 2 Target:** Server can process uploaded videos with requested analysis types
<ï¿½ **Phase 3 Target:** Production-ready server with error handling and performance optimization
