# Project Implementation Plan

## Goal
Transform the existing video processing pipeline into a modular HTTP server that can receive videos over HTTP, process them through configurable analysis pipelines, and return JSON results.

## Current Status: âœ… CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The video processing HTTP server is fully operational with modular analysis pipelines, MongoDB persistence, and comprehensive testing.

### Phase 4: Production Optimization ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling and logging**
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting and request validation**
- [ ] **Add monitoring and health checks**
- [ ] **Performance optimization for concurrent requests**

**Goals:**
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Request rate limiting and resource management
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Load testing and performance optimization

## Analysis Types Available

### Currently Implemented:
- `multimodal` - TwelveLabs comprehensive analysis
- `scene_detection` - Extract key frames and timestamps
- `transcription` - Audio-to-text using Whisper  
- `ocr` - Text extraction from scene images
- `captioning` - AI scene descriptions
- `matching` - Align transcriptions with visual scenes
- `structured_summary` - Generate searchable summaries
- `full_pipeline` - Complete end-to-end processing

### Dependencies:
- `matching` requires both `transcription` and `scene_detection`
- `structured_summary` requires scene data (from `ocr`, `captioning`, etc.)
- `full_pipeline` requires all components

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation:
```
HTTP Request â†’ FastAPI â†’ Temp File Storage â†’ Modular Pipeline â†’ MongoDB (optional) â†’ JSON Response
                                        â†“
                              Route to requested analysis types
                              (scene_detection, transcription, etc.)
```

## Environment Setup

### Required:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m fastapi dev server.py  # Development
python -m fastapi run server.py  # Production
```

### Testing:
```bash
python test_server.py  # Automated tests
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" -F "video=@video.mp4" -F "analyses=multimodal"
```

### API Documentation:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Core Implementation Complete:** Server processes videos with all analysis types and persists results
ðŸ“‹ **Next Target:** Production-ready server with monitoring and performance optimization
