Analyze the provided video reel featuring content from a tech blogger influencer
and extract a Timeline of Key Events that outlines significant moments, scenes,
or topics discussed in chronological order. For each event, include: the
Timestamp (in seconds) indicating when the event occurs; a detailed Event
Description explaining what happens visually and audibly during the event. Focus
on specific actions, on-screen text or captions, spoken phrases, and notable
audio elements such as sound effects or background noise. Highlight clear
transitions or changes in focus, such as shifts in scene, product introductions,
demonstrations, comparisons, or calls to action. Avoid speculation about meaning
and emphasize observable details to ensure precision. The output will create a
structured narrative of the video, supporting a Knowledge Base for LLMs to
assist influencers with content strategy, audience engagement, and trend
analysis. Output results in this JSON format: {"timeline_of_key_events":
[{"timestamp": "Start time in seconds.","event_description": "Detailed
explanation of the event."},{"timestamp": "Next event start
time.","event_description": "Detailed explanation of the next event."}]} Ensure
the JSON is valid, contains no formatting, markdown, or new line characters, is
compatible with JSON.parse(), and includes maximum detail to make the timeline
actionable and comprehensive.
