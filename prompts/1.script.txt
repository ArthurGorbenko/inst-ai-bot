Given a text-based description of a tech blogger's Instagram reel, create a detailed script as a reference for the blogger. The script should include:
Basic Details: Brief introduction, purpose of the video, and target audience.
Scenes: For each scene, describe what is happening on screen, including actions, transitions, tools, and interactions.
Audio: Specify background music, sound effects, or voice-over.
Spoken Content: Quote exact words spoken or narrated in the video to reflect dialogue delivery.
Captions: Provide captions or on-screen text aligned with the visuals and spoken words.
Focus on detailed scene descriptions, ensuring the script reflects visuals and spoken dialogue accurately. Emphasize tools, actions, and interactions shown in the video. Format the output as valid JSON.
