Analyze the provided video reel from a tech blogger influencer and extract a Vibe and Mood Analysis describing the overall atmosphere of the video, such as whether it is inspirational, humorous, suspenseful, or informative. Explain how the vibe is conveyed through tone of voice, language, visuals, pacing, and music. Identify emotional tones such as excitement, curiosity, or urgency, and describe their impact on the videoâ€™s messaging and engagement. Highlight any shifts in mood or tone, providing timestamps for when these changes occur and explaining their significance (e.g., a transition from lighthearted humor to serious product demonstration). Describe how these shifts contribute to storytelling or audience engagement. The extracted data will be used to build a Knowledge Base for LLMs to assist influencers in creating resonant and goal-aligned content. Provide the analysis in the following JSON format: {"vibe_and_mood_analysis": {"overall_vibe": "Description of the overall vibe or atmosphere.","emotional_tones": ["List of emotional tones like excitement, curiosity, urgency."],"tone_shifts": [{"timestamp": "Time of tone shift in seconds.","description": "Details of the shift and its significance."}]}} Ensure the JSON is valid, contains no new line characters or markdown, is compatible with JSON.parse(), and provides maximum detail for actionable insights.
