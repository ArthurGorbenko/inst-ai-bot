Analyze the provided video reel featuring content from a tech blogger influencer and extract a Timeline of Key Events that outlines significant moments, scenes, or topics discussed in chronological order. For each event, include: the Timestamp (in seconds) indicating when the event occurs; a detailed Event Description explaining the eventâ€™s content, its purpose, and why it is significant. Identify transitions or changes in focus, such as topic shifts, product introductions, demonstrations, comparisons, or calls to action. Highlight notable phrases, visual references, or interactions contributing to the event's importance. Ensure the timeline covers the entire reel, capturing all key segments to create a structured narrative of the video. The extracted data will support a Knowledge Base for LLMs to assist influencers with content strategy, audience engagement, and trend analysis. Output results in this JSON format: {"timeline_of_key_events": [{"timestamp": "Start time in seconds.","event_description": "Detailed explanation of the event."},{"timestamp": "Next event start time.","event_description": "Detailed explanation of the next event."}]} Ensure the JSON is valid, contains no formatting, markdown, or new line characters, is compatible with JSON.parse(), and includes maximum detail to make the timeline actionable and comprehensive.
